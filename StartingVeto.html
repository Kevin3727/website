                                    <p>For detailed analysis see my <a href="https://github.com/Kevin3727/IC-scripts/blob/master/StartingTrackAda.ipynb">GitHub page</a>.
                                    <br>
                                    
                                    <p>To do a starting track veto, new variables need to be introduced. “MinDist” is defined as a point’s minimum distance to the detector borders in three dimensions. Positive value means the point is outside of the detector volume and negative means it is inside. Detector side borders are defined as the broken hexagon i.e. a concave octagon, which is shape of the detector strings from above and detector bottom and top are define as the height of upper and lower DOMs in the middle string (string number 36), which is very close to DOMs heights on other strings. Now “Cascade MinDist” can be defined as the MinDist of event vertex which is calculated in millipede during energy loss reconstruction.
                                    <br>
                                    It is obvious that starting tracks should have a non-positive Casacade MinDist. However in reality about 25 percent of events with negative Casacade MinDist are through-going events. This is due to the fact that muon energy loss is stochastic and some events may deposit no lights during portion of their length, which by accident may be at the detector borders, ergo they may appear as starting events. The easiest way to reduce the factor error is to change the starting event cut from Casacade MinDist of less than zero to a lower limit. Since the probability of a muon event being dark in larger lengths is smaller. However, this probability depends on the energy of events, so it is best to make Casacade MinDist cut based on reconstructed energy of events.
                                    </p>

                                    <div>This plot shows histogram of decision functions from AdaBoost to classify starting tracks. Blue is starting tracks, red is through-going tracks, and black is 32.6 days of burnsample which agrees with the sum of the other two histograms.</div></center>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>After cutting out any events with a positive Casacade MinDist (cascade outside of the detector), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost">Adaboost</a> is used with three input variables viz. Casacade MinDist, Cascade Energy measured by millipede, and dE/dx of muon track coming from millipede’s energy losses. Figure above shows how good AdaBoost can separate starting from through-going events. In this plot the comparison of simulation with data (32.6 days of burnsample) and their agreement show that the feature are not coming from simulation. Burnsample is a random test sample from the data which will only be used for tests and will not be used for the final results. Buy cutting out events with having less than certain decision functions, we can increase purity of the sample but decreasing statistics (see Figure below). Purity is defined as ratio of number of truly starting events to all events in the sample. It is obvious that purity can only be measured in MC simulations.
                                    </p>

                                    <div>This plot shows purity versus number of events per year in the sample if you cut event at decision functions e.g. for 99% purity, we need to keep events with only decision function of more than 0.8, which means having about 2500 starting event per year, in which there are about 25 event, i.e. 1%, through-going events.</div></center>
